## Data Structures

### 1. Implement a Queue or Stack using TypeScript

__Question:__ Implement a basic Queue or Stack data structure using TypeScript.

__Real-world Use:__ Queues are often used in scenarios like task scheduling, and Stacks are used for things like backtracking algorithms.

### 2. Implement a Linked List using TypeScript

__Question:__ Create a singly linked list and implement methods for insertion, deletion, and traversal.

__Real-world Use:__ Linked lists are used in low-level memory management and can be useful for quick insertions and deletions.

### 3. Implement a Hash Table using TypeScript

__Question:__ Implement a hash table with methods for inserting, deleting, and searching elements.

__Real-world Use:__ Hash tables are used for quick data retrieval and are the underlying concept for objects in JavaScript.

### 4. Implement a Graph using TypeScript

__Question:__ Implement a graph data structure and include methods for depth-first and breadth-first search.

__Real-world Use:__ Graphs are used in social networks, recommendation engines, and routing algorithms like GPS.

## Algorithms

### 1. Implement Sorting and Searching Algorithms using TypeScript

__Question:__ Implement QuickSort or MergeSort for sorting an array. Also, implement binary search.

__Real-world Use:__ Sorting and searching are fundamental operations in databases and other data storage systems.

2. Implement Recursive Algorithms using TypeScript
Question: Write a recursive function to calculate the factorial of a number or to generate Fibonacci sequence.

Real-world Use: Recursion is often used in tree traversal algorithms and divide-and-conquer strategies.

3. Implement Dynamic Programming Algorithms using TypeScript
Question: Solve the Knapsack problem or coin change problem using dynamic programming.

Real-world Use: Dynamic programming is used in optimization problems, like resource allocation and scheduling.

4. Implement Divide and Conquer Algorithms using TypeScript
Question: Implement an algorithm that uses the divide-and-conquer strategy, like finding the maximum/minimum element in an array.

Real-world Use: Divide and conquer is used in sorting algorithms like QuickSort and in numerical simulations.

Design and Architecture
1. Implement Singleton Pattern using TypeScript
Question: Implement the Singleton design pattern.

Real-world Use: Singleton is used for logging, driver objects, caching, thread pools, and database connections.

2. Implement Factory Pattern using TypeScript
Question: Implement the Factory design pattern to create objects of different classes.

Real-world Use: Factory pattern is used in UI libraries and in managing and maintaining collections of objects that are different but have many common characteristics.

3. Design a Simple RESTful API using TypeScript
Question: Design a simple RESTful API and explain your design decisions.

Real-world Use: RESTful APIs are the backbone of many modern web services and applications.

TypeScript Specifics
1. Advanced Typing in TypeScript
Question: Write TypeScript code that demonstrates the use of advanced types like generics, union types, and literal types.

Real-world Use: Advanced types are used for creating robust and scalable codebases.

2. Use Decorators in TypeScript
Question: Write TypeScript code that uses decorators.

Real-world Use: Decorators are used in frameworks like Angular for dependency injection and declaring metadata.

3. Compiler Configuration in TypeScript
Question: Explain various compiler options in the tsconfig.json file and their use cases.

Real-world Use: Compiler configuration is essential for optimizing the performance and behavior of TypeScript applications.
