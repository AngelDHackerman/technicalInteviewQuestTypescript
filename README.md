## Data Structures

### 1. Implement a Queue or Stack using TypeScript

__Challange:__ Implement a basic Queue or Stack data structure using TypeScript.

__Real-world Use:__ Queues are often used in scenarios like task scheduling, and Stacks are used for things like backtracking algorithms.

### 2. Implement a Linked List using TypeScript

__Challange:__ Create a singly linked list and implement methods for insertion, deletion, and traversal.

__Real-world Use:__ Linked lists are used in low-level memory management and can be useful for quick insertions and deletions.

### 3. Implement a Hash Table using TypeScript

__Challange:__ Implement a hash table with methods for inserting, deleting, and searching elements.

__Real-world Use:__ Hash tables are used for quick data retrieval and are the underlying concept for objects in JavaScript.

### 4. Implement a Graph using TypeScript

__Challange:__ Implement a graph data structure and include methods for depth-first and breadth-first search.

__Real-world Use:__ Graphs are used in social networks, recommendation engines, and routing algorithms like GPS.

## Algorithms

### 1. Implement Sorting and Searching Algorithms using TypeScript

__Challange:__ Implement QuickSort or MergeSort for sorting an array. Also, implement binary search.

__Real-world Use:__ Sorting and searching are fundamental operations in databases and other data storage systems.

### 2. Implement Recursive Algorithms using TypeScript


__Challange:__ Write a recursive function to calculate the factorial of a number or to generate Fibonacci sequence.

Real-world Use__: Recursion is __often used in tree traversal algorithms and divide-and-conquer strategies.

### 3. Implement Dynamic Programming Algorithms using TypeScript

__Challange:__ Solve the Knapsack problem or coin change problem using dynamic programming.

__Real-world Use:__ Dynamic programming is used in optimization problems, like resource allocation and scheduling.

### 4. Implement Divide and Conquer Algorithms using TypeScript

__Challange:__ Implement an algorithm that uses the divide-and-conquer strategy, like finding the maximum/minimum element in an array.

__Real-world Use:__ Divide and conquer is used in sorting algorithms like QuickSort and in numerical simulations.

## Design and Architecture

### 1. Implement Singleton Pattern using TypeScript

__Challange:__ Implement the Singleton design pattern.

__Real-world Use:__ Singleton is used for logging, driver objects, caching, thread pools, and database connections.

### 2. Implement Factory Pattern using TypeScript

__Challange:__ Implement the Factory design pattern to create objects of different classes.

__Real-world Use:__ Factory pattern is used in UI libraries and in managing and maintaining collections of objects that are different but have many common characteristics.

### 3. Design a Simple RESTful API using TypeScript

__Challange:__ Design a simple RESTful API and explain your design decisions.

__Real-world Use:__ RESTful APIs are the backbone of many modern web services and applications.

## TypeScript Specifics

### 1. Advanced Typing in TypeScript

__Challange:__ Write TypeScript code that demonstrates the use of advanced types like generics, union types, and literal types.

__Real-world Use:__ Advanced types are used for creating robust and scalable codebases.

### 2. Use Decorators in TypeScript

__Challange:__ Write TypeScript code that uses decorators.

__Real-world Use:__ Decorators are used in frameworks like Angular for dependency injection and declaring metadata.

### 3. Compiler Configuration in TypeScript

__Challange:__ Explain various compiler options in the tsconfig.json file and their use cases.

__Real-world Use:__ Compiler configuration is essential for optimizing the performance and behavior of TypeScript applications.
